* If you submit a project that is similar to an existing project in the list, argument how it's better.
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
* Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
* Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
* Don't start the description with A or An.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* The pull request should have a useful title.
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!

## Updating your pull request

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
